- Create a class called `PrintYourName`
- Provide the class `PrintYourName` with a `main` method:

```
public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
```

- Inside the `main` method write the code that prints your name.

**Note**: in the console, after your name, you will notice a message like the following:

```
Process finished with exit code 0
```

Don't worry, it means that you didn't break Java, so there were 0 errors :)
