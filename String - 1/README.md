Create a String to hold some text, decide on the text you want it to hold and then name it appropriately. Print out your string in upper case, and in lower case.


```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        exercise1();
    }

 private static void exercise1() {
        System.out.println("\nExercise 1:");
        //Write your code here
    }
}
```
