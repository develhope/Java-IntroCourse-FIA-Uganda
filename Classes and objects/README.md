- Create a Java class called `Programmer`
- The `Programmer` class will have the following _instance variables_:
  - `name` as a string
  - `age` as an integer
  - `wearsGlasses` as a boolean
    The `Programmer` class will have the following _methods_:
  - `drinkCoffe()` - that prints in console `Espresso is the secret!`
  - `printDetails()` - that prints in console `NameHere is a AgeHere-yo programmer`
  - `hasGlasses` - that prints in console `Is NameHere wearing glasses? ` followed by the value of the dedicated variable
    Create a Java tester class called `TestProgrammers` where you:
  - create 2 `Programmer` objects (class instance)
  - define the state of the objects by assigning values to the _instance variables_
  - call the `drinkCoffee()` and `printDetails()` methods for the first `Programmer` object
  - call the `printDetails()` and `hasGlasses()` methods for the second `Programmer` object
