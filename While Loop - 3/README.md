You have an int called `number`. The user has to guess the value of `number`
The program:

- starts welcoming the user `Welcome!`
  -creates a random number (`1 <= number <= 10`) and assigns it to `number`
- then it asks the user to guess the number
- the program stops with a `Congratulations!` when the user enters the right value
