-Define a testing class with a `main()` method where you:
-Create a **not mutable** `List` of strings called `cityNames` using `asList()` that you populate with 3 city names
-Try to add a 4th city name at the end of the `List`
-If you get an exception, try to understand why and eventually comment the faulty code
-Try to change the 2nd item of the array, entering the value `Tegucigalpa`
print the content of `cityNames`
-Define a **mutable empty** `List` of strings called `kingsOfRome`
-Insert the names of the [7 kings of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Rome) into the mutable list
-Print the content of `kingsOfRome`
-Convert `kingsOfRome` into an array called `kingsOfRomeArray`, using `new String[0]` to determine the type of the array
-.Change the value of the 7th king in `kingsOfRomeArray` with the value `Lucius Tarquinius Supercar`

- Print the content of `kingsOfRomeArray`
